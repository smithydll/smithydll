Hi, people call me Smithy, currently residing in Sydney, NSW, Australia.

I have an engineering degree in Mechatronic engineering. I have been programming since I was a teenager, primarily with a Microsoft programming environment. I have been using C# since 2003, after teaching myself VB6 and upgrading to VB.NET. .NET Core running natively on Linux is the best thing to happen to .NET.

I am Engineering Director and Co-founder of METRHACK (Mechatronic + software development), a startup focused on bringing Systems Engineering and Project Management closer together, and making these tools more accessible to the engineers who need them and may not be aware of the Systems Engineering principles they are using.
